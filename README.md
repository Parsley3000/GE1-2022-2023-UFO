# Current Features & Assets
- Directional horzontial movement of model
- Lateral movement of model
- Rotational movement of model on Y axis
- Model smoothly tilts up to 15 degrees in the direction of it horzontial movement
- UFO model made in unity editor
- Rotation ring of glowing orbs that spin around the UFO
- Main camera tracks UFO model
- UFO core which tracks and postions itself in the middle of the UFO model (This is to keep the core always level as the UFO tilts)
- Glowing Laser created with Line renderer & raycast to record hit (Destroys objects tagged "Destoryable")
- Tractor beam using horzontial movement (Added a vertical force to objects tagged "Destoryable" when hitting, destroys them when the reach the beam origin)
- Cow model tagged "Destoryable"
- Cow spawner (Spawns x number of cows in a set area at random x & z coordinate)
- Leg spawner for UFO (legs need rework)
- Sound effects for Weapons, cows & music
- VR compatible main camera

# Works in progress
- Object mesh to improve look of tracker beam (make cylinder)
- New Blender UFO model
- Landing pad
- New retractable legs with joints for UFO
- More weapons (Plasma gun, rockets etc)
- VR rigged model to get in and out of UFO

# Controls
- Directional horzontial movement (awsd or arrow keys)
- Lateral movement (up: space bar, down: shift)
- Rotational movement (left: q, right: e)
- laser (left mouse buttom)
- tractor beam (right mouse buttom)

UFOs, or unidentified flying objects, are often associated with the idea of extraterrestrial spacecraft. The appearance of these craft is a subject of much speculation and can vary greatly depending on the individual's interpretation or description. Some people believe that aliens would design their spacecraft to be sleek, streamlined, and technologically advanced, with features such as glowing panels or intricate detailing. Others imagine more unconventional or organic shapes, such as spheres or irregular polygons.

UFOs have been a popular subject in literature and film for many years. In science fiction, they are often depicted as advanced alien spacecraft that visit or even invade Earth. These depictions can range from frightening and malevolent, to benevolent and peaceful.

In literature, UFO's have been featured in a wide range of works, from short stories and novels, to non-fiction accounts of alleged encounters. Many of these works explore the potential implications of extraterrestrial life and the possibility of alien visitation.

In film, UFO's have been depicted in a variety of genres, including science fiction, horror, and comedy. Some well-known examples include the "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," and "The War of the Worlds." These films often use special effects and advanced technology to depict the appearance and capabilities of the alien spacecraft.

It is worth noting that the depiction of UFO's in literature and film is often based on speculation and creative interpretation, and may not accurately reflect the true nature of these phenomena. There is no scientific evidence to suggest the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth.

"Destroy All Humans!" is a video game series that features aliens and their spacecraft as the main protagonists. In the game, players control an alien named Crypto who is tasked with completing various missions on Earth, often involving the destruction of human infrastructure and the collection of DNA samples.

The UFO in the game is depicted as a technologically advanced spacecraft with a sleek, saucer-like shape. It has a variety of features and abilities that allow Crypto to navigate the game world and complete his missions. Some of these features include:

- Flight: The UFO is capable of hovering and flying at high speeds, allowing Crypto to travel around the game world and reach different locations.

- Weapons: The UFO is equipped with a variety of weapons, including laser cannons, nuclear missiles, and tractor beams, which can be used to attack and destroy human     targets.

- Psychic abilities: Crypto has a range of psychic abilities that he can use to manipulate and control humans, including mind reading, telekinesis, and hypnosis. These   abilities are activated using the UFO's psychic amplifier.

- Cloaking: The UFO is equipped with a cloaking device that allows it to become invisible, making it harder for humans to detect and attack.

- Landing and takeoff: The UFO is able to land and takeoff from various locations in the game world, allowing Crypto to enter and exit the spacecraft as needed.

I will create my project to have similar features to the one depicted in the game
